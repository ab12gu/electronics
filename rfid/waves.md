### Radio Waves

- Type of electromagnetic radiation
- Longer wavelength than visible light
- WL order: *UV -> Visibile -> RF*
- Range from a few millimeters to hundreds of hundreds of miles
- Visible light has wavelengths in the 400 to 700 nanometer range
  - About 5,000 times shorter than the shortest wavelength radio waves.
- Radio waves oscillate at frequencies: 
  - few kilohertz to few terahertz (1 THz = 10^12 Hz).
