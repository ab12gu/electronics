# Overview

In my apartment complex, I found this radbike locked to the log of a shuffleboard table in the commonroom. Since it was 9pm on christmas, I knew it had to be stolen, so me and some friends lifted the table and pulled the bike with the U-lock out from under the table. 

The bike was poorly locked and since it was locked to a table, we were able to just lift the table away from bike. 

Using [bikeindex](https://bikeindex.org/), I found the original owners by asking someone about their missing bike posting from 3 months prior. They were able to tell me the keycode that matched the bicycle and I was succesfully able to return the bicycle to their original owners.

However, the owner had already replaced the bicycle with a newer version of the bicycle. The stolen one also had pieces replaced and broken. 

1. The front wheel was replaced with a non-disk break wheel, so no front breaks! 
2. The motor wasn't turning on and giving error 21, so an electrical issue. 
3. The button pad was wripped off so you couldn't easily change the settings.

The cost of repair of the bike wasn't worth it and the original owners called me up and decided to just give me back the bike instead as a donation :).
